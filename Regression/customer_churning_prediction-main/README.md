# customer_churning_predictions
**Overview**
Welcome to the Customer Churn Prediction project. This initiative focuses on analyzing and preparing data to predict customer churn, which is essential for enhancing customer retention strategies. The dataset used in this project, churn.csv, contains detailed information about customer behavior and service usage.
**Dataset Description**
The dataset includes a variety of features:

customerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
gender: Gender of the customer.
SeniorCitizen: Indicates if the customer is a senior citizen.
Partner: Whether the customer has a partner.
Dependents: Whether the customer has dependents.
tenure: Number of months the customer has been with the company.
PhoneService: Whether the customer has phone service.
MultipleLines: Indicates if the customer has multiple phone lines.
InternetService: Type of internet service used by the customer.
OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, TechSupport, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies: Various services utilized by the customer.
Contract: Type of contract the customer has.
PaperlessBilling: Indicates if the customer uses paperless billing.
PaymentMethod: Method of payment used by the customer.
MonthlyCharges: Monthly billing amount for the customer.
TotalCharges: Total billing amount accumulated by the customer.
Churn: Indicates whether the customer has churned (left the company).
Data Exploration
Initial Analysis
We begin by examining the dataset to understand its structure, including the initial rows and data types of each feature. This step helps us familiarize ourselves with the data.

**Data Cleaning**
Handling Missing Values:

We clean the dataset by addressing missing values, especially in critical columns like TotalCharges. This ensures the dataset is complete and accurate for analysis.

Encoding Categorical Variables:

We convert categorical variables with binary options (e.g., 'Yes'/'No') into numerical values (1/0). This transformation is crucial for making the data compatible with machine learning models.

**Data Visualization**
Tenure Distribution:

We analyze the distribution of customer tenure, segmented by churn status. This visualization helps us understand how the length of time a customer has been with the company influences their likelihood to churn.

Monthly Charges Distribution:

We explore the distribution of monthly charges, again segmented by churn status. This helps us determine if billing amounts have a significant impact on customer retention.

**Data Preprocessing**
Key Steps
Encoding Categorical Variables: We prepare categorical features for machine learning algorithms by converting them into numerical formats.

Feature Scaling: We standardize or normalize the features to ensure consistent scaling, which is important for many machine learning algorithms.

Data Splitting: The dataset is divided into training and test sets to evaluate model performance and avoid overfitting.

**Next Steps**
Feature Engineering: We may create new features or refine existing ones to improve model performance.

Model Training: Machine learning algorithms are applied to the preprocessed data to train predictive models.

Evaluation: The models are evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to measure their effectiveness in predicting customer churn.
